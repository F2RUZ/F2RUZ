## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I am a **Frontend Developer** with over **3 years of experience** in building production-level web applications, dashboards, user interfaces, and scalable front-end architectures. My specialty lies in mastering the **React ecosystem**, handling **complex state management**, architecting **clean UI systems**, and delivering **pixel-perfect responsive designs**.

Over the years, I have worked across a wide range of projects — from **B2B dashboards**, **CRM admin panels**, **data analytics platforms**, **landing pages**, and **education tech projects**, to **large-scale production systems like TOMU.uz**.  
I’ve had hands-on experience working in real teams, contributing to design decisions, security practices, and performance optimization.

In addition, **teaching has been a major part of my journey**. I have trained **hundreds of students**, helping complete beginners evolve into developers who can independently build web applications, understand JavaScript deeply, and confidently use modern tools.
